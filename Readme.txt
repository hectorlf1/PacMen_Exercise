Title of the project: PacMen Exercise

Description: This game allows the user to create an arbitrary amount of PacMan and have them move across the page while detecting the edges and avoiding them.
 
How to run: After the HTML is loaded, the user needs to add the desired amount of PacMan by clicking on the "Add PacMan" button. The user needs to click on "Start Game" to have them move.

Roadmap of future improvements: some future enhancements include,
A) Have each PacMen move with the classic animation style of the PacMan game (opening and closing mouth)
B) Let the user control the first PacMen created with the arrow keys.
